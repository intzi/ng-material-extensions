## Bundle Size
Xlsx (sheetjs) is a core dependency of the package. Since it is built as a CommonJs module, proper tree-shaking is not available during the builds. That's why **mat-table-exporter** loads Xlsx dependencies dynamically since **v10.2.3**.

Even if Xlsx is loaded dynamically, it is heavy by nature. If you'd like to benefit the extra minified version of xlsx (**xlsx.mini.min**; Doesn't support some features like **.xls** exporting) you can configure the module as shown below:

```
@NgModule({
  imports: [
    ...
    MatTableExporterModule.forRoot({xlsxLightWeight: true}),
  ],
 ]})
```
